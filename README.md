A Portfolio of Work Done at Durham College

This represents a small sample of the work I have done while a Computer Programmer Analyst student at Durham College. It does not represent the breadth of skills I developed, but offers a sampling of code and documentation that was done well.

If a project was done in a group setting, I have tried to select sample files that I worked on directly so that it is my work being represented, and not that of others.
